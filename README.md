# ARSimulation_Monobike

This is Unity project of a showcase of an AR app built with Unity 2021.3 and AR Foundation 5.0. In the app, the user can explore a bike which is placed on the floor.
The 3D model of the bike is not made by myself (see credits) but I textured this model as part of the Sketchfab Texturing Challenge “MonoBike”. See https://skfb.ly/6Ut8E
The style of the bike is inspired by the German history. “Simson” was a company in my hometown Suhl, Germany, in the former German Democratic Republic (GDR). They produced, among other things, motorcycles.
