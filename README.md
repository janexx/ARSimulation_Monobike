# ARSimulation_Monobike

This is a showcase of an AR app built with Unity 2021.3. In the app the user can explore a bike which is placed on the floor.
The 3d model of the bike is not made by myself (see credits) but I textured this model as part of the Sketchfab Texturing Challenge “MonoBike”. See https://skfb.ly/6Ut8E
The style of the bike is inspired by the German history. “Simson” was a company in my hometone Suhl, Germany, in the former German Democratic Republic (GDR). They produced among other things motorcycles.
